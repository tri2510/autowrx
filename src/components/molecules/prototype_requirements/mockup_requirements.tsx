# 🤖 AI-Driven Relevance Adjustments for "Passenger Welcome"

Following comprehensive evaluation of each requirement against the **Passenger Welcome** feature objectives, we present the following refined relevance recommendations:

## 📊 Priority Adjustments

### ⬇️ **REQ-003: Personalized Ambient Lighting**
**Original Relevance:** 3 → **New Relevance:** 1

**Rationale:** Driver-focused lighting sequences don't align with passenger-centric functionality. Generic ambient lighting provides limited user personalization value.


### ⬆️ **REQ-010: Seamless Welcome Experience**
**Original Relevance:** 2 → **New Relevance:** 5

**Rationale:** Core user experience requirement for all vehicle occupants. Critical foundation for passenger welcome functionality.


### ⬇️ **REQ-002: Driver Door Control**
**Original Relevance:** 3 → **New Relevance:** 2

**Rationale:** Passenger welcome systems should prioritize passenger-door functionality over driver-door control mechanisms.


### ⬇️ **REQ-008: Driver Authentication**
**Original Relevance:** 4 → **New Relevance:** 2

**Rationale:** Multi-factor authentication remains essential for driver security but presents lower priority for passenger personalization workflows.


## 🔄 Unchanged Requirements

All remaining requirements maintain their original relevance scores as they provide essential support for:

- Core system integration
- Security protocols
- Regulatory compliance
- OTA functionality

These foundational elements benefit all welcome feature implementations regardless of target user type.
